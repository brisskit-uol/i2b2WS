*==================================================================
* To build this project ready for development within Eclipse.
*==================================================================
(0) You must have Maven installed.
    Your settings.xml file must be the standard profiled
    settings.xml supplied with brisskit
    (ie: one pointing to the brisskit maven repository manager)

(1) Ideally, you should have the J2EE version of Eclipse.
    It makes for easier development and testing of Web Services.
    
(2) Within Eclipse, ensure you have the M2_REPO classpath variable set
    to point to your local maven repository (eg: /home/jblogs/.m2/repository) 

(3) Book out this project from svn.
 
(4) Run the install.sh script, which will set up:
    (a) the Eclipse classpath
    (b) the WebContent/WEB-INF/lib directory
    (c) and install the war file in your local maven repo.
    
 Repeat the latter step as often as needed.
    
*==================================================================
* To deploy the artifact to the brisskit remote repository.
*==================================================================
(1) Run the deploy.sh script, which will set up:
    (a) the Eclipse classpath
    (b) the WebContent/WEB-INF/lib directory
    (c) and deploy the war file to the brisskit repo.

*==================================================================
* NOTES...
*==================================================================
(1) The artifact name is governed by the pom's gav coordinates.
    So you will end up with something named like onyxWS-1.1-SNAPSHOT.war
    and this will be its install and deploy coordinates within the repositories.
    In order to run this within a test or live situation, you may need
    to rename the artifact (eg: to i2b2WS.war) to keep the standard URL. 
(2) Try not to commit class files, jars and wars to SVN.
(3) To deploy you will need authority upon the machine hosting the maven repo.
    Best to have a public/private ssh key setup for this.
(4) The webservice.properties file is an example/test version only.
    The real one exists in the i2b2 install project.
(5) The web.xml file has a workaround to eliminate errors (in JBoss 1.7.x)
    that occurr on deployment. You can see the original in the notes folder.
